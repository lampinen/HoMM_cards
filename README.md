# HoMM cards

A repository for my HoMM experiments on the card game tasks. 

These results are from my revised paper "Meta-mapping: toward human-like adaptibility from deep learning models." For the results from my NeurIPS workshop paper "Zero shot task adaptation via homoiconic meta-mapping" please see the `old_experiments` branch (<https://github.com/lampinen/meta_cards/tree/old_experiments>).
