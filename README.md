# HoMM cards

A repository for my meta-mapping experiments on the card game tasks. 

These results are from my revised paper "Transforming task representations to perform novel tasks" (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04318>).  For the results from my older NeurIPS workshop paper "Zero shot task adaptation via homoiconic meta-mapping" please see the `old_experiments` branch (<https://github.com/lampinen/meta_cards/tree/old_experiments>).
